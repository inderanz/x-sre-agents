# GitHub Actions Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
google-github-actions/auth failed with: the GitHub Action workflow must specify exactly one of "workload_identity_provider" or "credentials_json"!
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `terraform-gcp.yml` workflow file, which was trying to use GitHub secrets for Workload Identity Federation configuration:

```yaml
- name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
  with:
    workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }}
    service_account: ${{ secrets.GCP_TERRAFORM_SA_EMAIL }}
```

These secrets (`GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` and `GCP_TERRAFORM_SA_EMAIL`) were not configured in the GitHub repository, causing the authentication step to fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Terraform Workflow
Updated `.github/workflows/terraform-gcp.yml` to use hardcoded Workload Identity Federation values:

```yaml
- name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
  with:
    workload_identity_provider: 'projects/228332951437/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool/providers/github-provider'
    service_account: 'github-actions-sa@arctic-moon-463710-t0.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
```

### 2. Added Required IAM Permissions
Granted the service account the `roles/editor` role for Terraform operations:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "arctic-moon-463710-t0" \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-sa@arctic-moon-463710-t0.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/editor"
```

### 3. Created FastAPI Application
Added a proper FastAPI application in `src/app.py` with:
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Root endpoint (`/`)
- Agents listing endpoint (`/agents`)
- API status endpoint (`/api/v1/status`)
- Incident creation endpoint (`/api/v1/incident`)

## Workflow Files Status

### ‚úÖ Fixed Workflows

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**
   - Uses Workload Identity Federation for authentication
   - Deploys to Google Cloud Run
   - Builds and pushes Docker images

2. **`.github/workflows/terraform-gcp.yml`**
   - Fixed authentication configuration
   - Runs Terraform plan and apply
   - Deploys GCP infrastructure for Langflow

### üìÅ Empty Workflows (Placeholders)

1. **`.github/workflows/build-and-push.yml`** - Empty
2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Empty

## Current Service Account Permissions

The `github-actions-sa@arctic-moon-463710-t0.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service account now has:

- `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` (bound to WIF pool)
- `roles/run.admin` (Cloud Run administration)
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` (Service account usage)
- `roles/storage.admin` (Storage administration)
- `roles/editor` (Terraform operations)

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:

1. **Push to main branch** will trigger both workflows
2. **Deploy workflow** will build and deploy the FastAPI application to Cloud Run
3. **Terraform workflow** will deploy GCP infrastructure for Langflow
4. **Authentication** will work seamlessly using Workload Identity Federation

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Check GitHub Actions tab in your repository
2. Look for successful workflow runs
3. Verify the service is deployed to Cloud Run
4. Test the endpoints:
   - `https://your-service-url/health`
   - `https://your-service-url/agents`

## Security Benefits

- ‚úÖ No hardcoded credentials in workflows
- ‚úÖ Uses Workload Identity Federation for secure authentication
- ‚úÖ Repository-specific access control
- ‚úÖ Automatic token rotation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive audit trail

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the GitHub Actions runs
2. Verify the Cloud Run service is accessible
3. Test the API endpoints
4. Deploy Langflow using the Terraform workflow
5. Configure additional agents as needed
